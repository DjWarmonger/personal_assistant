## Current Time Message Implementation for Agents

* Issue: Agents lacked current time context, which could affect their decision-making and responses. Initial implementation attempted to add timestamp metadata to AIMessage objects, but encountered `AttributeError: 'AIMessage' object has no attribute 'response_metadata'` when trying to use the existing `add_timestamp` function.

* Resolution: Created `create_current_time_message()` utility function in `tz_common.langchain_wrappers.message` that generates an AIMessage with current UTC time in the content. Removed unnecessary `add_timestamp` call since the message content already contains the time information. Integrated the utility into all agent functions: `call_notion_agent`, `call_json_agent`, `call_writer_agent`, and `planning` function in planner agent.

* Prevention: 
  - Clarify requirements: Understand that message content with time information is sufficient without additional metadata
  - Check edge cases: Verify AIMessage object structure and available attributes before attempting to modify them
  - Use proven solutions: Follow existing patterns in the codebase for message creation and context building
  - Resolve ambiguity: When implementing utilities, consider whether metadata or content is the appropriate place for information
