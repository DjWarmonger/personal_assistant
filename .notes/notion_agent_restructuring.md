# NotionAgent Restructuring

## Issue: Disorganized code structure hindering development

* Issue: NotionAgent had a flat file structure with mixed responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain and extend. Import statements were inconsistent, and module responsibilities weren't clearly separated.

* Resolution: Restructured the codebase into a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  - `Agent/`: Contains core agent functionality (agentTools.py, graph.py, agents.py)
  - `operations/`: Houses Notion API operations (notion_client.py, blockCache.py, etc.)
  - `launcher/`: Holds application entry points (chat.py, commandLine.py)
  - `tests/`: Contains the test suite
  - `resources/`: Stores resource files like images

* Updates to imports:
  - Added proper relative imports using relative paths (e.g., `from .module` or `from ..package.module`)
  - Fixed circular dependencies by reorganizing code
  - Ensured test modules could properly import the restructured modules

* Documentation:
  - Updated README.md with new architecture information
  - Updated setup.md with correct setup instructions
  - Created comprehensive ALREADY_DONE.md to track completed work
  - Updated TODO.md to reflect current priorities

## Prevention: Standardized project structure

* Follow standardized project structure across all agents:
```
Agents/AgentName/
├── Agent/                     # Core agent functionality
├── operations/                # Domain-specific operations
├── launcher/                  # Application entry points
├── tests/                     # Test suite
└── resources/                 # Resource files
```

* Use proper relative imports with clear paths
* Create comprehensive documentation in each agent folder:
  - README.md: Project overview and architecture
  - setup.md: Setup instructions
  - TODO.md: Current priorities
  - ALREADY_DONE.md: Completed features

* When moving files, ensure all imports are updated properly and test thoroughly
* Use Python's package system properly with `__init__.py` files in each directory
