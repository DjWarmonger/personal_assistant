# NotionAgent Module Creation Notes

## Import Path Issues - Fix Summary

### Issue
- NotionAgent tests were failing due to import path issues
- Dependencies from tz_common.tzrag were causing failures with pydantic/ollama

### Key Insight
- Simplest solution: Remove the tzrag import from tz_common/__init__.py
- This eliminated the dependency chain without requiring complex workarounds

### Confusion Points
- Initially tried complex approaches with mocks and import wrappers
- Overengineered solutions were abandoned in favor of minimal changes
- Mistakenly attempted to modify actual tests rather than fixing import structure

### Process
1. ✅ Identified tz_common/__init__.py as source of issue (importing tzrag)
2. ✅ Removed `from .tzrag import TZRAG` line
3. ✅ Updated test imports to use direct paths instead of notion_agent namespace
4. ✅ Added proper sys.path manipulation in tests 
5. ✅ Cleaned up unnecessary files

### Discarded Approaches
- Mock libraries for tz_common.logs (unnecessary)
- Creating wrapper modules for imports (overcomplicated)
- Modifying test functionality (wrong approach)
- Using import_module with special paths (too complex)
- Trying to leverage pyproject.toml for import resolution (premature)

### Final Solution
Tests now run successfully with minimal changes:
- Direct imports in test files: `from operations.XYZ import...`
- Path setup: `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))`
- Command to run tests: `conda activate services && python -m pytest tests`

### Lessons Learned
- Start with the simplest possible solution
- Avoid modifying working code unnecessarily
- Proceed cautiously with incremental changes
- __init__.py files can be adjusted as needed for import paths
- When dependencies cause issues, tackle them at the source
