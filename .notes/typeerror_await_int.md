## TypeError: object int can't be used in 'await' expression

* Issue: Encountered a `TypeError` stating "object int can't be used in 'await' expression" when the `ChangeFavourties` tool was executed. The error occurred because its `async def _run` method used the `await` keyword with the `client.index.add_notion_url_or_uuid_to_favourites` method. This method is synchronous and returns an integer, which is not an awaitable object.

* Resolution: The `await` keyword was removed from the call to `client.index.add_notion_url_or_uuid_to_favourites` within the `ChangeFavourties._run` method in the `Agents/NotionAgent/Agent/agentTools.py` file. This resolved the `TypeError` as the synchronous function's integer return value is no longer being improperly awaited.

* Prevention: Ensure that the `await` keyword is exclusively used with awaitable objects (e.g., coroutines returned by `async def` functions, `asyncio.Future` objects). Before using `await`, verify if the function or method being called is asynchronous (`async def`) and returns an awaitable. If it's a synchronous function, it should be called without `await`.
