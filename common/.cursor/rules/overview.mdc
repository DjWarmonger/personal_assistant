# Project overview

TZ Common is a library of utils, serving as  apart of TZ Framework for Autonomous Agents.

# Project Goals

The goals of utils is to streamline AI agent development, by providing a set of tools and utilities that are easy to use and understand. In particular:

- Provide ready, out-of-the-box utils with minimal configuration.
- Hide internals (async, concurrency) from the user; no guesswork required.
- Keep each tool self-contained; avoid large dependency chains.
- Prefer direct usage over multiple layers of abstraction.

* Reduce code duplication

* Minimize cognitive load. User should not need to guess or assume anything in order to use the tool.

## Separate tools into different packages, especially:

* Data structures and ontologies

* LangChain wrappers

* Data converters

* Indexes and storage

# Architecture and methodologies

Each of the utils is supposed to be self-contained tool that can be simply used for a given purpose. Ease of use and understanding is the main focus, while generalizability is secondary.
