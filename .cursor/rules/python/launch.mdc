# Running Tests

Always run tests from the project root directory (`PersonalAssistant`). It is forbidden to use `cd` to launch tests. In case of any issue with testing directories, use `pwd`.

Here are example commands for each sub-project:

## Environment Setup

**Conda Environment (for JsonAgent and legacy projects):**
```bash
conda activate services
```

**UV Environment (for NotionAgent):**
```bash
# Windows
.\.venv_uv_services\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
source .venv_uv_services/bin/activate
```

## Common Library (tz_common)

**Using Conda:**
```bash
# Run all tests
conda activate services
python -m unittest discover -s common/tests

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest common.tests.test_imports
```

**Using UV:**
```bash
# Activate UV environment first
.\.venv_uv_services\Scripts\activate

# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover -s common/tests

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest common.tests.test_imports
```

## NotionAgent (UV Environment Only)

```bash
# Activate UV environment first
.\.venv_uv_services\Scripts\activate

# Run all tests for NotionAgent
python -m pytest Agents/NotionAgent/tests

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest Agents/NotionAgent/tests -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest Agents/NotionAgent/tests/test_specific_file.py

# Run specific test method
python -m pytest Agents/NotionAgent/tests/test_block_cache.py::TestBlockCache::test_specific_method

# Run all tests with output capture disabled (useful for debugging)
python -m pytest -s Agents/NotionAgent/tests
```

## NotionAgent Dashboard (Marimo)

```bash
# Activate UV environment first
.\.venv_uv_services\Scripts\activate

# Run dashboard in development mode (shows all cells and code)
marimo edit Agents/NotionAgent/launcher/dashboard.py

# Run dashboard in app mode (production UI only)
marimo run Agents/NotionAgent/launcher/dashboard.py
```

## JsonAgent (Conda Environment)

```bash
# Run all tests for JsonAgent
conda activate services
python -m pytest Agents/JsonAgent/tests

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest Agents/JsonAgent/tests -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest Agents/JsonAgent/tests/test_specific_file.py

# Run all tests with output capture disabled (useful for debugging)
python -m pytest -s Agents/JsonAgent/tests
```

## Running All Tests

To run tests for multiple sub-projects in sequence:

* If you need to test more than one test case from a suite, run the full suite
* If you need to test more than one suite, run all the tests at once

**Mixed Environment Workflow:**
```bash
# First, test NotionAgent with UV
.\.venv_uv_services\Scripts\activate
python -m unittest discover -s common/tests
python -m pytest Agents/NotionAgent/tests

# Then, test JsonAgent with conda
conda activate services
python -m pytest Agents/JsonAgent/tests
```

## Notes

- **NotionAgent** uses UV environment (`.venv_uv_services`) exclusively
- **JsonAgent** still uses conda `services` environment
- **tz_common** works with both environments (installed as editable package)
- UV environment includes all NotionAgent dependencies and tz_common in editable mode
