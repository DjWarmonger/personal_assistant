# Style Guidelines

## Python Formatting

- Use tabs for indentation
- Opening curly bracket only at the beginning of line
- Follow flake8 formatting
- After every class or method definition leave 2 empty lines
- Avoid empty lines with only whitespaces in it. Create empty lines with no tabs or spaces at all.

## Type Hints

- Always use proper type hints
- At the beginning of each method check if type hints conditions are met.
- Define custom types for clarity (e.g., `JsonDocument = Dict[str, Any]`) when such type is used in multiple places
- For complex data types that are passed around implement Pydantic models
- Use proper type hints with Union types when methods can return different types

## Enums and Constants

- Use enums for fixed sets of values. Avoid magic numbers or free-form strings.
- Document enum values with comments
- Declare enums early in file before any function declarations, or within a class before any method
