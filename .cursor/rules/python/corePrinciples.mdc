# Style Guidelines

## Python Formatting
   - Use tabs for indentation
   - Opening curly bracket only at the beginning of line
   - Follow flake8 formatting
   - After every class or method definition leave 2 empty lines

## Type Hints
   - Always use proper type hints
   - At the beginning of each method check if type hints conditions are met.
   - Use pydantic v1 for models
   - Define custom types for clarity (e.g., `JsonDocument = Dict[str, Any]`)

## Enums and Constants
   - Use enums for fixed sets of values. Avoid magic numbers or free-form strings.
   - Document enum values with comments
   - Declare enums early in file before any function declarations, or within a class before any method
