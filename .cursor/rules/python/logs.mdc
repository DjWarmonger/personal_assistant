# Use custom logger only

Project uses custom logger specifically designed to ease debugging of AI agent state with colored output.

- Always use logs from [logs.py](mdc:common/tz_common/logs.py) instead of print.
- Do not use other standard or library loggers
- Import `log` object at the beginning of every file:

```python
from tz_common.logs import log
```

# Log formatting

- Use first argument of log (colored) as a header. Use second part (not colored) for extra info, ie. detailed message or structure dump. In case of very short details part, ie. single string id of logged entity, use only first argument and skip the other.

- For collections of large structures use "\n".join(), possibly with list comprehension.

# Caveats

- Current logger has no `info` or `warning` level found in standard loggers
- Use `error` instead of `warning`.
- Instead of `info` use suitable type from among `flow`, `debug` or `common`
