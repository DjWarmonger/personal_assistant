# Cursor Rules Location

Rules for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

* Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
```
.cursor/rules/
├── your-rule-name.mdc
├── another-rule.mdc
└── ...
```

* Follow the naming convention:
         - Use camel-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

* Follow directory structure for language- or project-specific rules
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├───.cursor
│   └───rules
│       ├───agents
│       │   ├───agent1
│       │   └───anotherAgent
│       ├───common
│       ├───problemsAndSolutions
│       ├───python
│       └───C++
         └── ...
```
General and meta-rules are stored in main .cursor/rules folder

* Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

## Examples:

* Bad: Rule file in wrong location
    rules/my-rule.mdc
my-rule.mdc
    .rules/my-rule.mdc

* Good: Rule file in correct location
    .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
