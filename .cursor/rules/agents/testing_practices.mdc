# Testing Practices

This document outlines best practices for testing components of the PersonalAssistant project.

## Environment Setup

All tests must be run in the `services` conda environment:

```bash
conda activate services
```

## Test Frameworks

- Use **unittest** for tz_common tests
- Use **pytest** for agent tests (e.g., NotionAgent)

## Test Command Examples

```bash
# tz_common tests
conda activate services
cd F:\Programowanie\PersonalAssistant\common
python -m unittest discover

# NotionAgent tests 
conda activate services
cd F:\Programowanie\PersonalAssistant\Agents\NotionAgent
python -m pytest
```

## Test Isolation

Tests should be isolated from each other:

1. Each test should set up its own environment
2. Tests should not depend on each other's state
3. Use temporary files and directories when needed
4. Clean up any resources after tests complete
