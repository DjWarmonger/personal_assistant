- Cache all blocks along with parent-child relationships.
- Do not cache entire pages; instead, check modification date to invalidate outdated cache entries.
- Implement Time-To-Live (TTL) for cached blocks.

### Cache Updates

- Check page modification timestamps.
- If an item in search/database results is outdated, remove relevant cache entries.
