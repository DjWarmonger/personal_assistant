# Architecture

## Agents

- **Query Decomposition Agent**: May break down queries into actionable steps.
- **Main Notion-Browsing Agent**: Handles navigation, caching, and favorites.
- **Summary Agent (TODO)**: Summarizes or reports on retrieved content.
- **Edit Agent (TODO)**: Edits Notion pages and invalidates cache after editing.
- **Block Captioning Agent (TODO)**: Could annotate or caption blocks
  - Operate in the background. It is not worth waiting for caption agent if it stops the main process.
- **Background Agents (TODO)**: Potentially extract or structure data from fetched content.
