# Project Overview

Notion Agent interacts with Notionâ€™s API, navigating across pages, retrieving relevant content, and returning it to the user. It can handle requests from humans or other agents. Future plans include more advanced configurations.

# Project Goals

- Reliably retrieve relevant content from multiple Notion pages.
- Preserve all text without alteration or loss of context.
- Make retrieved data persistent, possibly transferring it to permanent storage, after which it might be deleted from Notion.
  - Process or enchance the data, providing valuable knowledge and insights. This knowledge may become input to other AI-based systems.

## Users

- Users can be human, another agent, or a script.
- Notion Agent can be queried once for a single response or engaged in a (short-lived) chat session.
- In script mode, all processing must occur in a single pass.

## Pain Points

- Notion API limits requests to 3 per second.
- Each Notion Block requires a separate fetch.
- Keyword-based text search may fail to capture user intent.
- Search often returns recent items, which might include already completed tasks.

## Optimization

- Minimize token usage.
- Cache fetched blocks and their children to speed repeated queries.
- Maintain parent-child relationships to preserve context.
- Strip unnecessary data from blocks to keep them concise.
- Consider replacing UUIDs/URLs with shorter placeholders.
- Avoid re-fetching or reprocessing identical content.
