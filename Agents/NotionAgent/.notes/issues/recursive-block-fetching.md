# Guide to Recursive Block Fetching

This document describes a past issue with recursive block fetching, the implemented solution, and guidelines for future development by an AI agent.

## Problem Summary

The `get_block_content` method in `notionService.py` was not fetching nested blocks recursively, leading to incomplete data. Agents received only the immediate children of a block, without the full hierarchy.

## Root Causes

1.  **Complex and Flawed Recursive Logic**: The original implementation used a complex recursive method (`_get_all_children_recursively`) that was prone to timing and dependency issues. This method has been removed.
2.  **Faulty Cache Dependency**: The fetching logic was overly reliant on the cache. If a block's children weren't already in the cache, the system would not attempt to fetch them from the Notion API, causing silent failures. Blocks without children were not marked in the cache as "children fetched," leading to redundant API calls.
3.  **UUID Indexing Timing Issues**: A critical flaw was that the system attempted to process nested children before their UUIDs were properly indexed and available. This caused the recursive walk to fail silently without raising explicit errors.

## Solution: Queue-Based Breadth-First Search (BFS)

The fragile recursive logic was replaced with a simple, robust, queue-based BFS implementation within a single `get_block_content` method. This approach eliminates recursion and makes the process less prone to timing and dependency issues.

**Key Features:**
-   **Simple Queue Processing**: Uses a FIFO queue to process blocks sequentially, one at a time. This avoids concurrency issues.
-   **Cycle Detection**: A `visited_nodes` set prevents infinite loops when processing the block tree.
-   **Parent Block Inclusion**: The root block's data is always included in the result.
-   **Robust Error Handling**: The process continues even if individual blocks fail to fetch.

**Implementation Snippet:**
```python
# Initialize queue with the starting block
fetch_queue = [(uuid_obj, True)]  # (uuid, is_root_block)
visited_nodes = set()

# Process queue one block at a time
while fetch_queue:
    current_uuid, is_root = fetch_queue.pop(0)
    
    # Skip if already visited (cycle detection)
    if current_uuid in visited_nodes:
        continue
    
    visited_nodes.add(current_uuid)
    
    # For root block, add parent block data first
    if is_root:
        parent_block_content = self.cache_orchestrator.get_cached_block_content(current_uuid)
        if parent_block_content:
            result.add_block(parent_int_id, parent_block_content)
    
    # Fetch children and add to queue if they have children
    # Note: this is a simplified representation of the actual implementation
    children_result = await self.cache_orchestrator.get_or_fetch_block(current_uuid, fetch_block)
    
    for child_int_id, child_content in children_result.items():
        result.add_block(child_int_id, child_content)
        
        # Add to queue if child has children
        if child_content.get("has_children", False):
            child_uuid = self.index.get_uuid(child_int_id)
            if child_uuid and child_uuid not in visited_nodes:
                fetch_queue.append((child_uuid, False))
```

## Guidelines for AI Agent Development

This section provides guidance for maintaining and extending the block fetching logic.

### Benefits of the BFS Implementation

-   **Simplicity**: The logic is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
-   **Reliability**: The sequential, non-recursive approach eliminates timing and dependency issues.
-   **Robustness**: It gracefully handles failures with individual blocks.
-   **Testability**: The components are easier to mock and test in isolation.

### Maintenance and Future Work

The implementation is designed for maintainability:
-   It has a clear separation of concerns and a simple control flow.
-   It is easy to extend with new features like depth limits or progress callbacks.
-   The error handling is robust and does not break the entire operation on single-point failures.

### Testing Lessons Learned

When working on this module, adhere to the following testing principles:

1.  **Test the Implementation, Not the Abstraction**: Mocks should reflect the actual implementation flow. For instance, `get_block_content` now directly calls `NotionAPIClient.get_block_children_raw`. Tests should mock this behavior, not a higher-level abstraction that no longer exists.
2.  **Rewrite, Don't Patch**: When a core implementation changes significantly, it is better to rewrite the tests from scratch rather than trying to patch them. This ensures tests remain clean, relevant, and easy to understand.
3.  **Remove Obsolete Code**: When methods are removed (like `_get_all_children_recursively`), their corresponding tests must also be deleted to keep the codebase clean and avoid confusion.
4.  **Handle Async Mocking Correctly**: Pay close attention to `async` and `await` in tests. Improperly awaited coroutines can lead to silent failures or "coroutine was never awaited" warnings. Ensure that mock return values for async functions are awaitable if necessary (e.g., using `asyncio.Future`).
