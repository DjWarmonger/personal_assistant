## BlockDict Implementation and NotionClient Return Type Changes

* Issue: User requested creation of new Pydantic class `BlockDict` and modification of NotionClient methods to return alternative of `BlockDict` or string representing error. The `get_all_children_recursively` method needed to return a flat dictionary mapping int id -> block content without nesting.

* Resolution: 
  - Created new `BlockDict` Pydantic class in `operations/blockDict.py` with dictionary-like interface
  - Modified `get_block_children` method signature to return `Union[BlockDict, str]`
  - Modified `get_all_children_recursively` method signature to return `Union[BlockDict, str]`
  - Updated implementation to return `BlockDict` instances instead of regular dictionaries
  - Added error handling to return error strings when UUID resolution fails or block_tree is None
  - Updated `agentTools.py` to handle new return types with proper type checking using `isinstance()`
  - Added conversion to regular dict for JSON serialization in tools using `to_dict()` method
  - All existing tests continue to pass (52 tests passed)

* Prevention: 
  - Use proper type hints with Union types when methods can return different types
  - Implement Pydantic models with dictionary-like interfaces when replacing basic dict types
  - Update tool implementations to handle new return types with proper type checking
