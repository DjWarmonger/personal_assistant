# Database Caching Prefix Issue

## Missing Database Caching in API Response Handler

* Issue: Databases fetched via `get_notion_page_details` were not being cached at all, despite having cache retrieval logic. The method was missing the actual caching step after successful API calls.
* Resolution: Added conditional caching logic using `cache.add_database()` for databases and `cache.add_page()` for pages based on the request type.
* Prevention: 
  - Always implement both cache retrieval AND cache storage in API handlers
  - Use consistent patterns: if there's a `get_*` cache method, ensure there's corresponding `add_*` cache method call
  - Add integration tests that verify caching behavior, not just API response handling

## Wrong Invalidation Method for Object Types

* Issue: Database invalidation was using `invalidate_page_if_expired()` instead of `invalidate_database_if_expired()`, causing databases to be treated as pages during cache invalidation.
* Resolution: Added conditional logic to use `invalidate_database_if_expired()` for databases and `invalidate_page_if_expired()` for pages based on object type.
* Prevention:
  - Use object type detection to route to appropriate methods
  - Create mapping between object types and their corresponding cache methods
  - Add tests that verify correct invalidation methods are called for each object type

## Search Results Treating All Objects as Blocks

* Issue: Search results processing assumed all results were blocks, using `invalidate_block_if_expired()` and `ObjectType.BLOCK` for all results, regardless of actual object type (page, database, block).
* Resolution: Added object type detection from API response `object` field and used appropriate invalidation methods and `ObjectType` enum values based on actual object type.
* Prevention:
  - Always check the `object` field in Notion API responses to determine actual object type
  - Use switch/conditional logic based on object type rather than assuming a single type
  - Test with mixed object types in search results

## Database Query Results Mishandling Object Types

* Issue: Database query results were treating returned pages as blocks, using `invalidate_block_if_expired()` instead of `invalidate_page_if_expired()`.
* Resolution: Changed to use `invalidate_page_if_expired()` since database queries return pages, not blocks.
* Prevention:
  - Understand Notion API semantics: database queries return pages, not blocks
  - Document expected return types for each API endpoint
  - Use appropriate object types based on API documentation, not assumptions

## Missing Cache Method Implementation

* Issue: Code was calling `cache.add_database_query_results()` method that didn't exist, causing potential runtime errors.
* Resolution: Implemented the missing `add_database_query_results()` method in `BlockCache` class with proper parameter handling and type conversion.
* Prevention:
  - Ensure all cache methods referenced in client code are actually implemented
  - Use consistent naming patterns for cache methods
  - Add method existence checks in tests or use static analysis tools

## Hardcoded String Constants Instead of Enum Values

* Issue: Object type comparisons used hardcoded strings like `"database"`, `"page"`, `"block"` instead of `ObjectType` enum values, reducing maintainability and type safety.
* Resolution: Replaced hardcoded strings with `ObjectType.DATABASE.value`, `ObjectType.PAGE.value`, `ObjectType.BLOCK.value`.
* Prevention:
  - Always use enum values instead of hardcoded strings for predefined constants
  - Establish coding standards requiring enum usage for type constants
  - Use linting rules to detect hardcoded strings that should be enum values

## Inadequate Test Coverage for Object Type Handling

* Issue: Existing tests didn't verify that different object types (databases, pages, blocks) were cached with correct prefixes and handled by appropriate methods.
* Resolution: Added comprehensive tests `test_database_caching_with_correct_prefix` and `test_database_invalidation_uses_correct_method` to verify correct behavior.
* Prevention:
  - Add tests for each object type when implementing caching functionality
  - Test cache key prefixes to ensure proper object type separation
  - Test that wrong methods don't affect objects of different types (isolation testing)
