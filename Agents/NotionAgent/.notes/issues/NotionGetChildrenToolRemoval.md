# NotionGetChildrenTool Removal Refactoring Issues

## Issue
Removed redundant `NotionGetChildrenTool` that was duplicating functionality of `NotionGetBlockContentTool`, but encountered several issues during the refactoring process.

## Resolution
- Removed redundant tool and unused public facade methods
- Renamed internal methods to follow Python conventions with underscore prefix
- Updated tests and documentation accordingly
- All functionality preserved, tests passing

## Prevention
**Key Issues Encountered:**

1. **Incomplete initial analysis**: Initially focused only on removing the redundant tool without identifying all unused methods in the call chain. Should have traced complete dependency graph first.

2. **Missing Python naming conventions**: Internal methods `get_block_children()` and `get_all_children_recursively()` should have been prefixed with underscore from the start to indicate they are implementation details.

3. **Phased discovery**: What seemed like a simple tool removal actually required systematic analysis of the entire method dependency chain from tools → facade → service layers.

**Best Practices for Future Refactoring:**
- Always trace the complete call chain when removing public methods
- Follow Python naming conventions immediately (underscore prefix for internal methods)  
- Distinguish between public API (used by external callers) vs internal implementation (used only within the same class)
- Analyze the entire dependency graph before starting changes
- Update tests and documentation as part of the same change, not as separate phases
